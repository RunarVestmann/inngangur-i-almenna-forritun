This repository contains code for a Python programming course that's meant to be an introduction to general programming.

**Course description**:<br>
This course will cover the Python programming language and apply it to create
various applications. General programming concepts, that modern programming languages utilize, will also be covered
alongside the Git and Github workflow which software companies and teams use today to improve collaboration and
manage their codebase.
This is a project-driven course which means that you'll have to be an active participant to get the most out of this course. This course is suitable as a preparation for students on their way to study computer science
and also for everyone else who is interested in learning the basics of programming. Therefore it's not
assumed that participants have knowledge of this subject before the course.
